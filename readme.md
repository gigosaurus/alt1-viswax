# Vis wax

vix wax calculation taken from https://runescape.wiki/w/MediaWiki:Gadget-viscalc-core.js

Current GE prices are retrieved from https://api.weirdgloop.org/

## Usage
```sh
#to initialize the repo and install dependencies
npm i
#build
npm run build
#alternatively to auto-rebuild when source files are changed
npm run watch
```

But mostly this requires opening the app inside alt1 to gain the full capture and overlay benefits.
